# RESTful-API-in-Go

REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) is used to deliver user functionality when dealing with websites. HTTP requests are used to communicate with REST APIs so users can navigate a URL website. These URLs can return certain information that is stored as part of the API. Any changes to data or information is done by accessing the database of that particular APIâ€™s URL. Most APIs these days would return a response to us in the form of JSON.
